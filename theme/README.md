## Usage

### Theme options

| Key         | Default value   | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `assetPath` | `"data/assets"` | Folder location to house extra assets (like the [author](#anatomy-of-an-authors-file) file.) |
| `instances` | `undefined`     | Array of [InstanceOptions objects](#-instance-options)                                       |

#### `instance` options

| Key           | Default value  | Description                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `basePath`    | `""`           | Root url for this instance. eg: `blog`                             |
| `contentPath` | `"data/posts"` | Folder location to house individual post-folders for this instance |
| `pagination`  | `undefined`    | Optional object, enables pagination if provided                    |

##### `pagination` options

| Key            | Default value | Description                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `postsPerPage` | `10`          | Amount of posts per paginated page                                                  |
| `prefixPath`   | `""`          | Optional string. Prefixes numbers in the URL paths from paginated pages. eg: `page` |

### Example usage

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog",
      options: {
        assetPath: "assets",
        instances: [
          {
            contentPath: "posts",
            basePath: "blog",
            pagination: {
              postsPerPage: 10,
              prefixPath: "page",
            },
          },
          {
            contentPath: "notes",
            basePath: "notes",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

This will result in a seperate `/blog` and `/notes` path.

The posts in `/blog` will be sourced from the `posts` folder.
The posts in `/notes` will be sourced from the `notes` folder.

Only posts in `/blog` will be paginated. With each paginated page holding a maximum of 10 posts.
Paginated pages after the one that lists the first 10 posts, will be prefixed be `/page`. eg. `/blog`, `/blog/page/2`, `/blog/page/3`, etc

Authors are shared between instances (be it `/blog` or `/notes`). A single author can write posts in both instances.
Refer to the [Adding authors](#Adding-authors) to see how to add authors.

### Additional configuration

In addition to the theme options, there are a handful of items you can customize via the `siteMetadata` object in your site's `gatsby-config.js`

```js
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    // Used for the site title, SEO, and header component title.
    title: `My Blog Title`,
    // Used for SEO
    description: `My site description...`,
    // Used for SEO and as default if an author has no twitter defined
    social: {
      twitter: `@NMeuleman`,
    },
  },
};
```

### Adding blog posts

In the folder that was created for the `contentPath` (`data/posts` by default). Create a folder to hold a blog post. Unless a [slug](#anatomy-of-a-blogpost) is provided, the title of this folder will serve as the slug for the blogpost.
Inside that folder, an `index.mdx` or `index.md` file will be the blog post itself. Along this file can be several different files specific to that blogpost (e.g. images)
If no [date](#anatomy-of-a-blogpost) is specified, the date the `.md(x)` file was created will serve as the date for the blogpost.

> NOTE: If you dislike having a folder per blogpost, loose `.md(x)` files are also supported. Place them inside the folder created for `contentPath`.
> The title of the file will then serve as the slug of the blogpost if a slug not specified in the post's [slug](#anatomy-of-a-blogpost) field.

#### Extra mdx features

This theme adds a couple of things you can do inside an `.mdx` file.
Codeblocks, obtained by surrounding a piece of code with three backticks <code>```</code> are powered by [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).
As a result, these codeblocks support syntax highlighting for [a range of languages](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/vendor/prism/includeLangs.js).

Highlighting specific lines is possible by passing a string to the `hl` (short for highlight-lines) attribute when writing a codeblock.
A title may also be added to the codeblock by passing a string to the `title` attribute when writing a codeblock.

The string you pass to `hl` should be understood by [node-parse-numeric-range](https://github.com/euank/node-parse-numeric-range).

The code below will highlight the code inside as the `jsx` language, highlight lines 1,2,3, and 5, and put a small block above it displaying `src/components/CodeBlock.jsx`
(Omit the `#` in front of these lines, I only used them here to make the three backticks show up).

````
# ```jsx hl=1-3,5 title=src/components/CodeBlock.jsx
# import React from 'react'
# import Highlight, { defaultProps } from 'prism-react-renderer'
#
# export default ({ children, className }) => {
#   const language = className.replace(/language-/, '') || ""
#   return (
#     <Highlight {...defaultProps}
#       code={children}
#       language={language}
#     >
#       {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
#         <pre className={className} style={{ ...style }}>
#           {tokens.map((line, index) => {
#             const lineProps = getLineProps({ line, key: index })
#             return (
#               <div key={index} {...lineProps}>
#                 {line.map((token, key) => (
#                   <span key={key}{...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
#                 ))}
#               </div>
#             )
#           }
#           )}
#         </pre>
#       )}
#     </Highlight>
#   )
# }
# ```

### Adding authors

In the folder that was created for the `assetPath` (`data/assets` by default). Create a file called `authors.json` or `authors.yaml`. This file (or files, both formats can work together) holds an array of [author objects](#anatomy-of-an-authors-file).

### Anatomy of an authors file

An authors file contains a top level array filled with object describing individual authors.
An author can have several different field with information specific to them.

| Key         | Value  | Required | Description                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Anatomy of a blogpost

The blogpost itself (`.md` or `.mdx` file for now, others coming soon) can have several different fields with extra information.
In `.md` or `.mdx` files these fields are set via the frontmatter.

| Key            | Value                        | Required | Description                                                                        |

| `date`         | date string                  | no       | Date the post was written.                                                         |
| `updatedAt`    | date string                  | no       | Date the post was last updated.                                                    |

| `authors`      | array of `shortName` strings | no       | Authors of the post. <br/>Should not be used in combination with the `author` key. |
| `author`       | `shortName` string           | no       | Author of the post. <br/>Should not be used in combination with the `authors` key. |

| `cover`        | relative path to cover image | no       | Displayed as cover image, in social cards.                                         |
| `published`    | boolean, defaults to `true`  | no       | Include the post in production.                                                    |
| `slug`         | string                       | no       | The last part of the URL for the post.                                             |

### Components used in this theme.

Overwriting these with your own is highly encouraged. This can be done via [component shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/).

#### Query components

These components house the Gatsby template-query.
They lightly transform that data and pass it on to the corresponsing [Page component](#page-components).
Changes to these might require changes to the corresponding [Page components](#page-components) because of that.
Location to shadow: `@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog/templates/<component-name>`

- BlogPostQuery
- BlogPostListQuery
- TagQuery
- TagListQuery
- AuthorQuery
- AuthorListQuery

#### Page components

These components render an entire page.
Each component is wrapped in the `Layout` component that centers the content and adds the `Header`.
Location to shadow: `@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog/components/<component-name>`

- BlogPostPage
- BlogPostListPage
- TagPage
- TagListPage
- AuthorPage
- AuthorListPage

#### Regular components

These components are used by the [Page components](#page-components)
Location to shadow: `@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog/components/<component-name>`

- PostCard
- PostExtra
- Pagination
- CodeBlock
- SeriesSelect

#### Mdx components

These components are usable in `.mdx` files without importing them first.

- Every component from [Gatby-mdx-embed](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed)
- Aside

To add to this list, shadow `@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog/components/mdx-components`.
Every component that is exported as a named export will be available for use in `.mdx` under that name, without importing it first.

example declaration of a `<Shia />` component

```js
// in src/@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog/components/mdx-components/index.js
import React from "react";
export * from "@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog/src/components/mdx-components/index";
const Shia = ({ children }) => (
  <p>Don't let your dreams be dreams! {children}</p>
);
export { Shia };
```

example usage in an `.mdx` file

```
# Shia LaBeouf says:

<Shia>
  Just do it!
</Shia>
```

#### List of layout style related components

- Header
- layout
- Main

#### How to shadow components

If you want to use [component shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/), create a file at the following path in your site:

```
src/@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog/components/<component-name>.js
```

#### Example usage in MDX

In any MDX blogpost:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```mdx
import { ComponentName } from "@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog"
---
<frontmatter-fields>
---

# Lorem Ipsum
<ComponentName />
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

> Components from [Gatby-mdx-embed](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed) can be used without first importing them

#### Example usage in React components

In any React component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { ComponentName } from "@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog";

export default () => (
  <div>
    <ComponentName />
  </div>
);
```

### Styling

This theme uses [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/) extensively for styling.
That means a lot of the "look" (CSS-styling) can be overridden by the user, through their own [theme-file](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec).
To use one, export an object that adheres to [the theme-ui spec](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec) from `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`.

It is recommended that you extend [this theme's theme-ui file](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/gatsby-theme-nicky-blog/blob/master/theme/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js) and add your own overrides on top.
The code below does this by merging the config used by this theme and overwriting a few `color` values that are used by this theme to make a beautiful, beautiful, website.

```js
import { themeConfig } from "@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog";
import merge from "deepmerge";

const theme = merge(themeConfig, {
  colors: {
    text: `tomato`, // the named CSS color
    mutedText: `coral`, // the named CSS color
    background: `#000`,
    mutedBackground: `rgb(50,50,50)`,
    primary: `red`, // the last entry from the array in the theme's config for "red", not raw CSS red
    mutedPrimary: `red[2]`, // the red at index 2 from the array in the theme's config for "red"
  },
});

export default theme;
```

#### Styling code blocks / syntax themes

To apply a different syntax highlighting theme to code blocks. Overwrite the styles under `styles.CodeBlock` in the theme-ui file.
To adjust the styles used for line highlighting, add new rules under `styles.CodeBlock.lineHighlight`.
To adjust the styles used for the title section of a codeblock, add new rules under `styles.CodeBlock.title`.

Various pregenerated themes are available in the [`/presets` folder of @theme-ui/prism](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/tree/master/packages/prism/presets).
To use them, import your chosen theme's `.json` file, and apply it to the `styles.CodeBlock` of your theme-ui file.

The code below imports a syntax highlighting theme based on the popular [night-owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) by [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo).
It also adds some styles so highlighting a line, or adding a title to the codeblock, will match the installed syntax theme.

```js
import nightOwl from "@theme-ui/prism/presets/night-owl.json";
import { themeConfig } from "@nickymeuleman/gatsby-theme-blog";
import merge from "deepmerge";

const theme = merge(themeConfig, {
  styles: {
    CodeBlock: {
      ...nightOwl,
      highlightLine: {
        backgroundColor: `#01121f`,
        borderLeftColor: `#9ccc65`,
      },
      title: {
        backgroundColor: nightOwl.backgroundColor,
        borderBottomColor: `#262a39`,
        color: nightOwl.color,
      },
    },
  },
});

export default theme;
```

      Like this `<Aside>` https://github.com/jlengstorf/learnwithjason.dev/blob/master/site/src/components/aside.js
      also `<YouTube>`, `<Twitter>`, `<CodeSandbox>` etc.
      maybe use https://github.com/MichaelDeBoey/gatsby-remark-embedder for part of those embeds.
      https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed is in line with original idea of creating the components myself.
      Implemented.
      Caused some issues: detailed https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed/issues/11
- [x] Migrate to theme-ui v0.3
- [x] Rename Underpost to PostExtra
- [x] Rework default `contentPath` and `assetPath`
- [x] Remove duplicate remark images plugin
- [x] Page per author
- [x] Avatar support for authors
  - [ ] Use avatars in demo.
- [ ] CLI to scaffold out now blogposts (See how Kyle Shevlin does this.)
- [x] theme border values. Only take the sharp edge off, don't round too much.
- [x] add support for updating blogposts (updatedAt frontmatter field?)
- [x] Rework how cards are done `BlogList` https://inclusive-components.design/cards/
- [ ] Use [inversion of control](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/inversion-of-control/) and [component composition](https://youtu.be/3XaXKiXtNjw) more.
  - eg. Using `props.children` inside the `PostExtra` component.
- [x] Refactor all page creations to use same pattern. Query in templates/* that only renders a component named *Page. That component has the `<SEO />`
- [x] Rename all top level page components to have `Page` in their name.
- [x] Relocate `Layout` component from templates to `Page` components.
- [x] Rename all gatsby templates to have `Query` in their name. Since they are made up of a query, passing that data to a `Page` component.
- [x] Handle data in every page component the same way
- [x] Handle passing of `basePath` the same everywhere.
- [x] Sort named exports from this theme
- [x] Put theme options in a Gatsby node
      https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/applying-theme-options-using-custom-configuration-nodes/
  - [x] Make React hook that queries for those options and use the hook instead of passing options around in pageContext etc
- [ ] Ability to add custom OG images for pages like BlogListPage (also use the `<SEO />` `image` prop for that?)
  - [x] `type` prop for `<SEO />`? Different behavior based on type?
    - The `basePath` prop now fulfills this role.
  - [ ] refactor `Page` components so `<SEO />` can easily be swapped?
- [x] Give components a `variant` so the user can theme them via theme-ui
- [x] Fix links in headers being hidden (because of the link icon)
- [x] Table of contents
  - [x] Style active link in table of contents
    - [ ] Only run that logic on desktop and if table of contents is open
- [x] Refactor exports to be named exports as often as possible (reason: node import syntax getting closer to ESM, but only named. While not needed here because of compilation, good to be consistent everywhere, regardless of technology used.)
- [x] Refactor @theme-ui/prism to self-rolled setup of prism-react-renderer for increased flexibility.
  - [x] Add line highlighting
  - [x] Add code title support
  - [ ] document everything
- [x] Support multiple basePaths (eg `/blog`, `/notes`, and `/tips`)
  - [x] Redo theme options, users can define multiple `instances`. Some options are specific to the instance.
  - [x] Create folders based on the `contentPath`
  - [x] Support sharing authors across those multiple basePaths.
    - Moved authors page paths from `/<basepath>/author/<name>` to the top level `/author/<name>` as a result.
  - [ ] Support different `Page` components for different instances.
- [ ] PaginationContext and PageContext in BlogPostListPage are duplicated right now
- [ ] Redo how the `<SEO />` gathers information. It's becoming an a-prop-calypse in there.
